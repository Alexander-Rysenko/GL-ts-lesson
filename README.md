## TS lesson

```
npm run COMMAND
"dev:w": "webpack-dev-server -w --progress --colors",
"build": "webpack",
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "npx jest --watch"
```

- make a fork
- clone project
- Run `cd [projectName]` and  `npm i` commands
- copy src/noname directory, to src and rename it to your name
- you can extend or overwrite tslint or tsconfig by your own, but I recommend to use strict rules
- Write solutions for src/homework.md, pure functions, and cover them by unit tests
- lymarenko.denys - basic examples
- Make a PR
- Feel free to add interesting tasks and make a PR
